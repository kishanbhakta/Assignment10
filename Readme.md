Re-Create An Etsy Page - https://www.etsy.com/search?q=whiskey

2. Use Bourbon / Neat to help you out (optional, but suggested)
3. You are free to change the search term to whatever you'd like.
4. We haven't covered how to fetch data using JavaScript, so just copy the data and store it in a variable.
5. Everything should be styled as closely as possible, including the Header/Sidebar/Links/Search
6. You should implement hover events and link the items to their proper Etsy product pages
8. Also, no need to make any of the form elements work, just style them properly
9. Lastly, worry about the structure first, the JS second and the fine details of the design last

> Note: The assets (heart and hamburger icons) are in an assets folder for you.
