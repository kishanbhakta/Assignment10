This pattern for Renaissance men&#39;s pants includes: Simple paned pants, with and without edge trim and piping Elaborately decorated pants, with and without slashes and cutouts, Simple un-paned pants. The Paned Slops and Breeches pattern is from the &quot;Fantasy Fashions&quot; series. The patterns are produced especially for making medieval outfits that are easily and comfortably worn today without sacrificing authenticity. Multiple sizes are available with each pattern. The instructions are clear and easy to follow, with many hints for proper construction and fit. Waist sizes from 32 inches through 44 inches are given, with instructions to make the pattern adjustable for any size. The instructions are clear and easy to follow, with hints for proper construction and fit. This pattern set is easy to follow, with few pieces for each of the items. This pattern is fairly easy, except that the &quot;rise&quot; for the easy breeches needs to be fitted. Apparently the instructions for fitting the rise are not as clear as they could be for someone who has never fitted men&#39;s pants. Be sure to have someone help you with this part or make a mock up with cheap fabric and fit that to your man before cutting into your expensive velvet or brocade! \r\n\r\n Great for Musketeer, Tudor, Medieval, Renaissance Clothing. Excellent for SCA events, Medieval living history events, Robin Hood, Merlin\r\nPerfect for Game of Thrones Costume and for Steam Punk Living history events",

"title": "Wine Bottle Stopper Display Stand - black acrylic lasercut - Double",
"description": "Show a pair of Curtin&#39;s Creations Wine or Whiskey Bottle Stoppers in this handsome, laser-cut, black acrylic stand!  The holes are sized to perfectly hold the stoppers at the middle ring - firm enough to hold it securely, but easy to slide in and out.\n\nDon&#39;t just sit your stoppers on a shelf - help them stand out, and keep them together!  \n\n** Note that one of these comes free with every two-stopper set I sell!  If you don&#39;t want black, convo me and we can discuss options. **\n\nThis stand measures 3.25&quot; long, just over 2&quot; high, is about 3/16&quot; thick, and has a satisfying weight and feel.  (Same dimensions as a credit card, only much thicker.)\n\nIf you&#39;re interested in getting a stand in a different color for a bit more, get in touch - there are plenty of options.\n\n\nWhile this stand&#39;s awfully sturdy, all my creations come very carefully wrapped for safety. If you have special shipping needs, let me know and I&#39;ll certainly accommodate.\n\nVisit my Etsy store::\n   http://CurtinsCreations.etsy.com/\n\nMy wine stoppers are here:\n   http://www.etsy.com/shop/CurtinsCreations?section_id=7359176\n\nMy blog for thoughts, glaze samples, info about my process and progress, and more:\n   http://www.curtinscreations.com\n\n\n\n(Online presence by TheArtistsBullhorn.com)",

"announcement": "Just a potter playing with mud and fire to bring imagination to life.  Unique wine stoppers, creatures, ring stands, bottles & more, handmade in Vermont!\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve been enjoying pottery since 2000 when I sat down at a wheel with a lump of clay and rediscovered the joy of creation.  Since then I&#39;ve been learning to twist clay, fire, and glazes into my own unique expressions.  Functional pieces are fine, but right now, I&#39;m focused on my wine stoppers and Curly Creatures.  Whimsical little things, each creature is thrown on a wheel, carefully pulled off to add a tail, then hand-modified to add fins, legs, scales... anything you or I can imagine!  Stoppers are similar, but totally handbuilt.  I try to give each piece its own personality, but all almost always get a smile from people who see them.  &quot;So cute!&quot;  &quot;I love it - what *is* it?&quot;\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy my creations as much as I do.\r\n\r\nSee my blog for in-depth info on my work, photos, and thoughts:\r\n  http://www.curtinscreations.com\r\n\r\nAnd watch my facebook Page for pictures of Creations in progress, discount codes, to tell your friends, or just to say hi!

White speckling on orange, and a black mark on each haunch - the glazing is really strong and beautiful up close. Fun, distinctive stoneware and steel art made in Vermont.\r\n\r\nHe&#39;ll look great with his face buried in any bottle - a very distinctive and powerful piece, perfect for your favorite wine, whiskey, vinegar, home-made spirits, or even perfume.\r\n\r\n&quot;Haunches&quot; is about 4 inches long from tip to tip, and about an inch and a quarter across at his widest.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis USA-made business end is made of the highest quality stainless available anywhere, which is then attached using industrial-strength epoxy.  (See my blog for more info if you&#39;re curious about my process.)  Unlike most stoppers that are plated and can flake or pit, these are medical-grade and can be kept in a bottle for as long as you like. These are *not* your run-of-the-mill corner store bottle toppers -- they are a labor of love, each truly one-of-a-kind, take hours to make, and are built to last!\r\n\r\n\r\nAll my creations come very carefully wrapped for safety.

"announcement": "Just a potter playing with mud and fire to bring imagination to life.  Unique wine stoppers, creatures, ring stands, bottles & more, handmade in Vermont!\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve been enjoying pottery since 2000 when I sat down at a wheel with a lump of clay and rediscovered the joy of creation.  Since then I&#39;ve been learning to twist clay, fire, and glazes into my own unique expressions.  Functional pieces are fine, but right now, I&#39;m focused on my wine stoppers and Curly Creatures.  Whimsical little things, each creature is thrown on a wheel, carefully pulled off to add a tail, then hand-modified to add fins, legs, scales... anything you or I can imagine!  Stoppers are similar, but totally handbuilt.  I try to give each piece its own personality, but all almost always get a smile from people who see them.  &quot;So cute!&quot;  &quot;I love it - what *is* it?&quot;\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy my creations as much as I do.\r\n\r\nSee my blog for in-depth info on my work, photos, and thoughts:\r\n  http://www.curtinscreations.com\r\n\r\nAnd watch my facebook Page for pictures of Creations in progress, discount codes, to tell your friends, or just to say hi!

"description": "Show off your Curtin&#39;s Creations Wine or Whiskey Bottle Stopper in this handsome, laser-cut, crystal clear acrylic stand!  The hole is sized to perfectly hold the stopper at its middle ring - firm enough to hold it securely, but easy to slide in and out.\n\nDon&#39;t just sit your stopper on a shelf - help it stand out!  \n\n** Note that one of these comes free with every stopper I sell!  If you don&#39;t want black, convo me and let me know. **\n\nThis stand measures 3.25&quot; long, just over 2&quot; high, is about 3/16&quot; thick, and has a satisfying weight and feel.  (Same dimensions as a credit card, only much thicker.)\n\nIf you&#39;re interested in getting a stand in a different color or with a custom phrase for a bit more, get in touch - there are plenty of options.  (See here for a sample custom stand: https://www.etsy.com/transaction/1011415538?)\n\n\nWhile this stand&#39;s awfully sturdy, all my creations come very carefully wrapped for safety. If you have special shipping needs, let me know and I&#39;ll certainly accommodate.\n\nVisit my Etsy store::\n   http://CurtinsCreations.etsy.com/\n\nMy wine stoppers are here:\n   http://www.etsy.com/shop/CurtinsCreations?section_id=7359176\n\nMy blog for thoughts, glaze samples, info about my process and progress, and more:\n   http://www.curtinscreations.com\n\n\n\n(Online presence by TheArtistsBullhorn.com)",

I can be described as a bit of a hippy. I&#39;m OK with that. I love all things natural. I try to incorporate that in all aspects of my life. I paint, I knit, I make soap, and I create my own jewelry. Much of my time is spent in my art studio further perfecting my crafts. I am always open to learn new forms of art, as I love to expand my horizons.\n\nI like a bit of whimsy. Jewelry should be fun and not taken too seriously (kind of like life).\n\nI am inspired by textures and colors from things like furniture and fabrics to nature. I love art that you can touch and experience. The combination of art and jewelry to me is natural. \n\nMy studio is a place of peace. I receive so much joy from what I do, I hope that will translate to you through my jewelry. My wish is that the wearer receives many years of enjoyment.",

All international orders are fully insured regardless of the shipping method.\r\n\r\nWe gladly offer COMBINED SHIPPING on all items, worldwide.\r\n\r\nWe are also happy to ship via USPS Express Mail if you need an item extra fast. Just send us a message to let us know and we will notify you of the cost for Express Shipping.\r\n\r\nInternational Customers: Please be aware of what your country&#39;s customs rules and fees are. International customers are responsible for paying any and all customs fees and taxes that may be assessed by their country&#39;s customs office upon item delivery. Customs fees are not associated with the seller or the shipping price of the item.",
"policy_refunds": "Our top priority is to provide high quality vintage clothing and wonderful customer service to ensure you are happy with your item. If you have any questions about an item or our policies, or if you would like additional photos of an item, please let us know. We are always happy to help!\r\n\r\nAll vintage items are final sale. Please remember that vintage clothing has been previously loved. Minor normal wear (such as minor fading from age/washing or a couple unnoticeable missing sequins) is often part of a piece&#39;s vintage charm. We have incredibly high standards of quality, and we meticulously inspect every piece stitch by stitch multiple times for flaws. Any flaws beyond minor normal wear are noted in the item&#39;s description. All of our items arrive ready to wear.\r\n\r\nIn the rare event that we have missed a flaw, please notify us immediately if you wish to return the item. In this case, we will only accept a return on an item provided it still has our sales tags attached and is in the same condition in which it was shipped to you. So please inspect your items carefully prior to removing any tags. Returned items must be postmarked within 4 business days.\r\n\r\nReturns due to fit are not accepted. Please refer to the measurements provided in the listing to determine if an item will fit. If you have any questions about whether or not an item will fit, please let us know and we will gladly assist you.",
"policy_additional": "MEASUREMENTS:\r\n-We meticulously measure every item and include all measurements in the description. We also provide an estimated size, but as standardized sizing can vary please keep in mind this is just an estimate. The best way to determine if an item will fit is to refer to the measurements provided. If the fabric has some stretch to it, we will include a range of measurements to represent both the unstretched measurement up to what the fabric will comfortably stretch. (For example, a bust measurement of 32&quot; - 35&quot; indicates the bust measures 32&quot; unstretched and can accommodate up to 35&quot; when stretched). All items are measured laying flat, with the bust, waist and hips measurements doubled. If you have any questions about determining fit, just ask! We are always happy to help!\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE:\r\n-Belts and accessories are not included unless otherwise noted in the item description.\r\n\r\n-Some items have been altered for a better fit. All items that are shortened are professionally hemmed.\r\n\r\n-Some items may be pinned in the photos to show proper fit.\r\n\r\n-While we try our hardest to ensure the colors in our photos are as accurate as possible, please note that all monitors display colors differently. Because of this there may be slight color variances between the actual garment and how it appears in the photos.",
